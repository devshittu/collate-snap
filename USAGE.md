Excellent! I'm glad the build was successful.

Now, let's proceed with running and testing your `collate` utility within the Docker environment you've set up, using your specific Docker and Docker Compose versions.

[cite_start]Your `docker-compose.yml` file already defines a service named `collate-test`[cite: 75]. We will use `docker compose run` to execute commands within this service. This command is ideal because it creates a new container for the command and then removes it after execution, keeping your environment clean, which aligns with your goal of not messing with your development system.

Here are the full commands to run and test your `collate` utility:

1. **Start the `collate-test` service in the background (detached mode):**
    [cite_start]This command will start your `collate-test` container, which is configured to run `systemd`[cite: 75]. Running `systemd` is crucial for `snapd` to function correctly within the container, which you might need for future snap-related operations or if any part of your script implicitly relies on `snapd` services.

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d collate-test
    ```

2. **Verify the container is running:**
    You can check the status of your running container to ensure `collate-test` is up.

    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```

    You should see `collate-test` listed with a `healthy` or `running` status.

3. **Run the `collate.sh` script interactively within the container:**
    This allows you to execute the `collate` script as if you were inside the container. [cite_start]The `collate.sh` script is copied to `/app` and `WORKDIR` is set to `/app` in your `Dockerfile`[cite: 76]. [cite_start]The `collate.sh` script is installed as `bin/collate`[cite: 82], so we'll execute it from that path relative to `/app`.

    For example, to run the `init` command:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec collate-test /app/bin/collate init
    ```

    Or, to combine files from a specific directory (e.g., `test_dir` which would be present if you were running tests, or any directory you map into the container via volumes):

    ```bash
    # Create a dummy directory and file in your host machine for testing
    mkdir -p my_test_data
    echo "Hello from Dockerized collate" > my_test_data/file.txt

    # Then, run collate inside the container
    docker compose exec collate-test /app/bin/collate my_test_data -o /app/output.txt
    ```

    [cite_start]*Note*: The `-o /app/output.txt` is important because the `collate` script will write to a path relative to its current working directory within the container (`/app`), and volumes map your host directory (`.`) to `/app` inside the container[cite: 75]. This means `output.txt` will appear in your host's project root.

4. **Run your test suite (`test_collate.sh`) within the container:**
    [cite_start]Your `test_collate.sh` script is comprehensive and designed to cover all functionalities[cite: 86]. This is the most effective way to validate your `collate` utility within the Dockerized environment.

    ```bash
    docker compose exec collate-test /app/test_collate.sh
    ```

    This command will execute the `test_collate.sh` script, and you will see the test results directly in your terminal.

5. **Stop and remove the container (after testing):**
    Once you are done with testing, it's good practice to stop and remove the running container to free up resources.

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

These commands provide a complete workflow for running and testing your `collate` utility within a Docker container, keeping your host system clean.
